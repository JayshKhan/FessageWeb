# Fessage Web File Transfer
[Click Here for Updated Version](https://github.com/JayshKhan/FessageWebReEngineered)
 
Welcome to Fessage Web, a dynamic file transfer system that not only allows file transfers between computers but also provides online file storage capabilities. This web implementation of the original Fessage File Transfer project is the result of a semester project for the Web Engineering course at Riphah International University, developed by Jaysh Khan and Muhammad Aaraif Hanif.

# Overview
Fessage Web, unlike its predecessor, is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and custom PHP. It brings the convenience of browser-based file transfers and online file storage, making your files accessible from anywhere.

Unlike the original application, Fessage Web doesn't have the storage errors reported in the Java version. This improvement demonstrates our commitment to learning from past experiences and progressively enhancing our projects.

## Technologies Used
Fessage Web incorporates the following technologies:

HTML: Used for structuring the web pages.
CSS: Applied for styling and layout of the web pages.
JavaScript: Enables interactive and dynamic features on the web pages.
PHP: A server-side scripting language used for backend logic and handling database interactions.
Project Highlights
File Transfers: Facilitates the transfer of files between computers using web technologies.
Online Storage: Allows users to store files online, making them accessible from any location.
